# mazesolver-bot

Telegram bot which can show the shortest path between two 
selected points n the maze picture

## How does it work?
1) Run `/solve` command in the [bot](https://t.me/mazesolver_bot);
2) Send picture of the maze;
3) Choose start point;
4) Choose end point;

## Examples
Run `/example[n]` command and send proposed picture to the bot with `/solve` command:
* `/example1` shows why you should not use pictures with
an empty space around the maze
* `/example2` a computer-drawn maze
* `/example2` a hand-drawn maze
